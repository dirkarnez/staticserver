### TODOs (`2.0.0`)
- spa mode bugs

### Known Issue(s)
- The mime-type in Windows registry may be modified by other software causing wrong `Content-Type` in response, see issue(s)
  - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32350
    - How to fix: `regedit` -> go to `Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.js` -> set `Content Type` to `application/javascript`
    - It should be platform-independent anyway
    
- Some server-side files does not have their correct `Content-Type` in response (`text/html; charset=utf-8`), found
  - [ ] `.woff`
  - [ ] `.ttf`

### MIME
- [Common MIME types - HTTP | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types)
- Sample `mime.yaml` file (in case user-defined mime is needed, create one under the working directory)
- https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/main/core/router/mime.go
- [MIME | yhirose/cpp-httplib: A C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/?tab=readme-ov-file#static-file-server)
