### Known Issue(s)
- The mime-type in Windows registry may be modified by other software causing wrong `Content-Type` in response, see issue(s)
  - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32350
    - How to fix: `regedit` -> go to `Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.js` -> set `Content Type` to `application/javascript`
    - It should be platform-independent anyway
    
- Some server-side files does not have their correct `Content-Type` in response (`text/html; charset=utf-8`), found
  - [ ] `.woff`
  - [ ] `.ttf`
